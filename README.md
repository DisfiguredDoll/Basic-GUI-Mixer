# Basic-GUI-Mixer
Turn your old desktop into a mixer! This is a minimalist GUI that allows the user to adjust the mix of the input signal from the computer's line-in, the signal from the computer's applications, and the master mix.

This could potentially be expanded to a computer with many soundcards or line-ins to make a larger mixer. Enjoy!
